# c() function (called the “combine” function)
# For example, you can use the c() function to store numeric data in a vector. 
```{r}
c(2.5, 48.5, 101.5)
```
# To create a vector of integers using the c() function, you must place the letter "L" directly after each number.
```{r}
c(1L, 5L, 15L)
```
# You can also create a vector containing characters or logicals.
c(“Sara” , “Lisa” , “Anna”)
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Determining the properties of vectors 
# Every vector you create will have two key properties: type and length.  

# You can determine what type of vector you are working with by using the typeof() function.
typeof(c(“a” , “b”))
